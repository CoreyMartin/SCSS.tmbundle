Sass Syntax Bundle
==================

A [Sass & SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) syntax bundle for [TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate) and [click here for Sublime Text 2](https://github.com/kuroir/SCSS.tmbundle/tree/SublimeText2)

## Installation

    mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/TextMate/Bundles
